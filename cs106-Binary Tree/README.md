This assignment used polling data for the 2020 US presidential (primary) elections.

Background
Before the two main political parties put forward their nominees for president, the Democratic and Republican parties hold primary elections to determine who their nominee will be. The Republican nominee is essentially predetermined to be President Trump. The Democratic party is converging on a decision, but over the past year or so, the outcome has been very uncertain. In order to make repeated predictions about the likely outcome of the Democratic party nomination, pollsters (statisticians) regularly conduct polls (surveys) to sample Democratic primary voters and ask who they plan to vote for. These results are compiled, released, and eagerly tracked by the news media and public to determine which candidate currently has the largest percentage of support.
(The website FiveThirtyEight makes polling data for presidential primary candidates available.)

Assignment overview:
1- Implemented a Linked Binary Tree given the BinaryTree interface so that generic objects that implement the compareTo method from the Comparable interface can be inserted into your tree. Implement all three orders for tree traversal.
2-Store Polling Data: Create class that implement the Comparable interface so that polling data objects are put in order based on the candidateâ€™s last name.
3-Get Polling Data from CSVs and inserted into binary tree. Output results.
